## Motivation 
X-rays are a commonly used diagnostic tool in medical settings. They are used to visualize the internal structure of the body and help doctors diagnose various diseases and conditions. However, the interpretation of X-rays can be challenging and requires a high level of expertise. Misinterpretation of X-rays can lead to misdiagnosis and delay in treatment, resulting in further complications.

To address this issue, DiagnoX was developed to assist doctors in interpreting X-rays. It uses advanced machine learning algorithms to analyze X-rays and provide a preliminary diagnosis. This preliminary diagnosis is presented to the doctor, who can then confirm or modify it based on their own expertise.

## ‚ùì Problem Statement
To develop app for medical professionals who have a limited amount of time to review and analyze X-ray or MRI scans, which can lead to misdiagnosis or missed diagnoses. Improving the traditional methods of generating reports for X-ray or MRI scans can be time-consuming and labor-intensive. To help the patients in remote or underserved areas may have difficulty accessing healthcare services, including the expertise needed to analyze X-ray or MRI scans.

## ü•∏ Description
To address this issue, DiagnoX was developed to assist doctors in interpreting X-rays. It uses advanced machine learning algorithms to analyze X-rays and provide a preliminary diagnosis. This preliminary diagnosis is presented to the doctor, who can then confirm or modify it based on their own expertise.

DiagnoX is designed to be highly user-friendly, with a simple interface that can be easily integrated into a hospital's existing system. The system is also highly customizable, allowing doctors to modify the algorithms and criteria used for diagnosis based on their preferences.

## üëå What it does/ Features:
- Get diagnosed X-Rays with pre-diagnosis through deep-learning model
- Get prognosis and chances if you can die in the next 10 years or not through official hospital reports.
- Get recommendation for users to visit nearby doctors.
- Easy to understand Minimilastic and Interactive UI/UX Design

## Steps to run locally
Clone the repo in your local machine and setup python and flutter environment. Create .env file similar to .env.sample file with all the required fields.

### Mobile Application
1. Go into `app/` directory by doing `cd app` in terminal.
2. Configure firebase for android by folllowing the [doumentation](https://firebase.flutter.dev/docs/installation/android/).
3. Write `flutter run` in the terminal to start the application.

### Flask Server
1. Install all the required packages in python virtual enviroment `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run `python app.py` in the root directory of the project.
